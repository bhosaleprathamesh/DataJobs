# The Analysis
Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions which were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skill_perc[df_skill_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_percent', palette='flare')

    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.1f}%', va='center')

    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results

*Bar Graph Visualizing the skills requested for Data Analysts in India 2023*

### Insights
* SQL Dominance: SQL is consistently a top requirement across all three roles, emphasizing its importance in the data ecosystem.
* Python's Versatility: Python's growing popularity is evident, particularly in data engineering and data science roles.
* Cloud Adoption: The increasing demand for cloud skills reflects the industry's shift towards cloud-based data solutions.
* Role-Specific Skills: Each role has unique skill requirements, highlighting the need for specialization within the data field.

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

### Visualize Data

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
df_plot = df_da_ind_perc.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10', linewidth=2)

plt.show()
```

## 3. How are the yearly salaries distributed across top 3 job roles?

To identify the top 3 job roles in India, I filtered the dataset with roles having the most number of jobs. Then I looked at there salary distirbutions to get an idea which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(18, 6), sharey=True)
sns.histplot(df_da['salary_year_avg'], kde=True, fill=True, ax=axs[0], color='royalblue', edgecolor='black')
sns.histplot(df_de['salary_year_avg'], kde=True, fill=True, ax=axs[1], color='royalblue', edgecolor='black')
sns.histplot(df_ds['salary_year_avg'], kde=True, fill=True, ax=axs[2], color='royalblue', edgecolor='black')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
### Results

*Histogram Visualizing the Salary Distribution of Top 3 job roles in India 2023*

### Insights

* The disparity in salary distributions suggests varying levels of skill demand and market value for these roles. Data Engineering skills appear to be in higher demand, leading to premium salaries.
* The data hints at potential career trajectories. Data Analysts might consider upskilling to move into Data Engineering for better compensation.
* The positive skew in all distributions might indicate a larger pool of entry-level to mid-level professionals compared to senior positions with top salaries.

# The Analysis
Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions which were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skill_perc[df_skill_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    #df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_percent', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_percent', palette='flare')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 75)

    #For Percentage Markings
    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.1f}%', va='center')

    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in India Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
